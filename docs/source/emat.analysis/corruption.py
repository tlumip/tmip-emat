# # Identifying Model Problems

# %% [markdown]
# Once a series of experiments has been conducted for a core model, it
# is suggested that an analyst review the results to confirm that the 
# model is behaving as expected.  TMIP-EMAT provides some visualization
# tools to review results in a graphical manner, which is a generally 
# convenient method to review this experimental data.
#
# To demonstrate these tools, we will use the Road Test example model included
# in TMIP-EMAT.  We can quickly construct and run a design of experiments
# to exercise this model and populate some results to visualize, and in 
# this example we will use an intentionally broken model input, to demonstrate
# one way that bad results might manifest.

# %%
import emat.examples
scope, db, model = emat.examples.road_test(yamlfile='road_test_corrupt.yaml')
design = model.design_experiments()
results = model.run_experiments(design)

# %% [markdown]
# The "corrupt" scope for the Road Test model includes a policy lever to set
# the lane width for the link.  You might expect that increasing the lane 
# width might increase the effective capacity on the link, but as coded any
# deviation from exactly 10.0 feet will result in substantial extra delay in
# the build travel time, regardless of any other factors.  Running the experiments
# with this broken input will invalidate the entire set of results, but here
# we'll assume that we don't know *a priori* that the lane width parameter is 
# broken.
#
# Given this set of experimental results, we can display a scatter plot matrix
# to see the results.  This is a collection of two-dimensional plots, each
# showing a contrast between two factors, typically an input parameter (i.e. 
# an uncertainty or a policy lever) and an output performance measure, although
# it is also possible to plot inputs against inputs or outputs against outputs.
#
# The `display_experiments` function in the `emat.analysis` sub-package can 
# automatically create a scatter plot matrix that crosses every parameter with
# every measure, simply by providing the scope and the results.  By default, 
# plots that display levers are shown in blue, plots that show uncertainties
# are in red.

# The unexpected non-monotonic response function in the second row
# of figures should jump out at the analyst here as problematic.
# If we are not expecting this kind of response, we should carefully
# review the model code and results to figure out what (if anything)
# is going wrong here.
