# # PRIM
#
# Patient rule induction method (PRIM) is a scenario 
# discovery algorithm that operates on an existing set of data 
# with model inputs and outputs (i.e., you have already
# designed and run a set of experiments using either a
# core model or a meta-model.)  Generally, a decently 
# size set of experiments (hundreds or thousands) 
# is used to describe the solution space, although 
# no minimum number of experiments is formally required.
#
# PRIM is used for locating areas of an outcome space that 
# are of particular interest, which it does by reducing 
# the data size incrementally by small amounts in an 
# iterative process as follows:
#     
# - Candidate boxes are generated.  These boxes represent 
#   incrementally smaller sets of the data. Each box removes 
#   a portion of the data based on the levels of a single 
#   input variable.
#   * For categorical input variables, there is one 
#     box generated for each category with each box 
#     removing one category from the data set.
#   * For integer and continuous variables, two boxes 
#     are generated – one box that removes a 
#     portion of data representing the smallest set of 
#     values for that input variable and another 
#     box that removes a portion of data representing 
#     the largest set of values for that input.  
#     The step size for these variables is controlled 
#     by the analyst.
# - For each candidate box, the relative improvement 
#   in the number of outcomes of interest inside 
#   the box is calculated and the candidate box with 
#   the highest improvement is selected.
# - The data in the selected candidate box replaces 
#   the starting data and the process is repeated.
#
# The process ends based on a stopping criteria.  
# For more details on the algorithm, 
# see [Friedman and Fisher (1999)](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/prim.pdf) 
# or [Kwakkel and Jaxa-Rozen (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215301092).
#
# The PRIM algorithm is particularly useful for scenario 
# discovery, which broadly is the process of 
# identifying particular scenarios of interest in a 
# large and deeply uncertain dataset.
# In the context of exploratory modeling, scenario 
# discovery is often used to obtain a better understanding 
# of areas of the uncertainty space where a policy or 
# collection of policies performs poorly because it is 
# often used in tandem with robust search methods for 
# identifying policies that perform well 
# ([Kwakkel and Jaxa-Rozen (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215301092)).

# ## The Mechanics of using PRIM

# %% [markdown]
# In order to use PRIM for scenario discovery, the analyst must
# first conduct a set of experiments.  This includes having both
# the inputs and outputs of the experiments (i.e., you've already
# run the model or meta-model).

# %%
import emat.examples
scope, db, model = emat.examples.road_test()
designed = model.design_experiments(n_samples=5000, sampler='mc', random_seed=42)
results = model.run_experiments(design_name='mc')

# %% [markdown]
# In order to use PRIM for scenario discovery, the analyst must
# also identify what constitutes a case that is "of interest".
# This is essentially generating a True/False label for every 
# case, using some combination of values of the output performance 
# measures as well as (possibly) the values of the inputs.
# Some examples of possible definitions of "of interest" might
# include:
#
# - Cases where total predicted VMT (a performance measure) is below some threshold.
# - Cases where transit farebox revenue (a performance measure) is above some threshold.
# - Cases where transit farebox revenue (a performance measure) is above above 50% of
#   budgeted transit operating cost (a policy lever).
# - Cases where the average speed of tolled lanes (a performance measure) is less 
#   than free-flow speed but greater than 85% of free-flow speed (i.e., bounded both
#   from above and from below).
#
# The salient features of a definitions for "of interest" is that
# it can be calculated for each case independently if given the set 
# of inputs and outputs, and that the result is a True or False value.
#
# For this example, we will define "of interest" as cases from the 
# Road Test example that have positive net benefits.

# %%
of_interest = results['net_benefits']>0

# %% [markdown]
# Having defined the cases of interest, to use PRIM we pass the
# explanatory data (i.e., the inputs) and the 'of_interest' variable
# to the `Prim` object, and then invoke the `find_box` method.

# %%
from emat.analysis.prim import Prim

# %%
discovery = Prim(
    model.read_experiment_parameters(design_name='mc'), 
    of_interest, 
    threshold=0.2,
)

# %%
box1 = discovery.find_box()

# %% [markdown]
# The `find_box` command actually provides a number of different possible boxes
# along a (heuristically) optimal trajectory, trading off coverage against
# density.  We can plot a static figure showing the tradeoff curve using the 
# `show_tradeoff` command:

# %%
ax = box1.show_tradeoff()

# %% [markdown]
# This figure shows the trade-off between coverage and density.
#
# - **Coverage** is percentage of the cases of interest that are in the box
#   (i.e., number of cases of interest in the box divided by total number of 
#   cases of interest).
#   The starting point of the PRIM algorithm is the unrestricted full set of cases, 
#   which includes all outcomes of interest, and therefore, the coverage starts at 
#   1.0 and drops as the algorithm progresses.  
# - **Density** is the share of cases in the box that are case of interest
#   (i.e., number of cases of interest in the box divided by the total 
#   number of cases in the box). 
#   As the box is reduced, the density will increase (as that is the objective 
#   of the PRIM algorithm).  
#
# For the statistically minded, this tradeoff can also be interpreted as
# the tradeoff between Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative)
# error.  High coverage minimizes the false negatives, while high density
# minimizes false positives.
#
# By default, the PRIM algorithm sets the "selected" box position as the 
# particular box at the end of the peeling trajectory (highest density, at 
# the top of the top of the tradeoff curve), which has the highest 
# density, but the smallest coverage.

# In a Jupyter notebook, the analyst can interactively view and select other possible
# boxes using the `tradeoff_selector` method.  This method opens a dynamic viewer
# which shows the same basic figure as the static one above, but when hovering over
# each possible tradeoff point, a pop-up box appears with more details about
# that point, including which dimensions are restricted, and what the restrictions
# are.  A selection of the preferred tradeoff can be made by clicking on any point.[<sup>†</sup>](#_blank "This website does not include a live Python kernel to 
# execute commands, so some interactive functionality is not available.")

# %%
box1.tradeoff_selector()

# %% [markdown]
# The analyst can choose to manually override 
# the selection programmatically using Python code, selecting 
# a preferred box (by index) that trades off density and coverage.

# One of the features of the `ema_workbench` implementation of PRIM
# is the ability to generate a plot of the resulting box,
# overlaid on a 'pairs' scatter plot of the various restricted 
# dimensions.
#
# In the figure below, each of the five restricted dimensions represents
# both a row and a column of figures.  The off-diagonal charts show 
# bi-dimensional distribution of the data across two of the five actively
# restricted dimensions.  These charts are overlaid with a red rectangle
# denoting the selected box.  The on-diagonal charts show the relative
# distribution of cases that are and are not of interest (unconditional
# on the selected box).

#
#     In the current version of EMAT, a `PrimBox` does not
#     inherit from `Box` as used in manual scenario discovery, as 
#     it is created and used in a slightly different way by the
#     `Prim` algorithm defined in the EMA workbench, but there is a
#     conversion method.  Future version of EMAT may unify these
#     tools in a common object type.

# ## Non-Rectangular Boxes

# %% [markdown]
# Regardless of any analyst intervention in box selection
# using the `select` method, initial box identified using PRIM
# will always be a rectangle (or, more generally, a hyper-rectangle).
# Every restricted dimension is specified independently, not conditional
# on any other dimension.  
#
# A second box can be overlaid after the first to expand the solution
# to include a non-rectangular area.  The second tier box itself is
# still another rectangle, but it can be defined using different boundaries,
# possibly on different dimensions, to give in aggregate a non-convex shape.
# Creating such a second box is done by calling the `find_box` method again,
# after the particulars of the first box are finalized.

# %%
box2 = discovery.find_box()

# %%
box2

# %% [markdown]
# The cases considered for the second box are *only* those cases
# not within the first box.  Because our first box had a relatively
# high coverage and high density, we have already captured most of
# the cases of interest and not too many other cases, so the 
# second box has a much diminished trade-off curve.  The maximum
# value of the coverage for this second box is one minus the 
# selected final coverage of the first box.

# %%
box2.show_tradeoff();

# %% [markdown]
# We can also make a similar scatter plot for this second box.
# Because this is the second box, the method will only plot the 
# points that remain (i.e. the ones not included in the first
# box).  This results in a "blotchy" appearance for may of the 
# graphs in this figure, as most of the "of interest" cases were
# captured previously.
