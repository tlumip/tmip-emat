# # Meta-Model Creation

# %% [raw] {"raw_mimetype": "text/restructuredtext"}
# MetaModels can be created directly from other core models using the
# :meth:`create_metamodel_from_design <model.AbstractCoreModel.create_metamodel_from_design>`
# or :meth:`create_metamodel_from_data <model.AbstractCoreModel.create_metamodel_from_data>`
# methods of a core model, or by using the :func:`create_metamodel` function, which can
# create a MetaModel directly from a scope and experimental results, without requiring
# a core model instance.  Each of these functions returns a :class:`PythonCoreModel` that
# already wraps the MetaModel in an interface ready for use with other TMIP-EMAT tools,
# so that in typical cases the user does not need to interact with or know anything
# about the :class:`MetaModel` class itself, unless they care to dive in to the underlying
# core or mathematical structures.
#
# .. autofunction:: create_metamodel

# %% [markdown]
# To demostrate the creation of a meta-model, we will use the Road Test example model
# included with TMIP-EMAT.  We will first create and run a design of experiments, to
# have some experimental data to define the meta-model.

import emat.examples
scope, db, model = emat.examples.road_test()
design = model.design_experiments(design_name='lhs')
results = model.run_experiments(design)

# %% [markdown]
# We can then create a meta-model automatically from these experiments.

# %% [markdown]
# If you are using the default meta-model regressor, as we are doing here, 
# you can directly access a cross-validation method that uses the experimental
# data to evaluate the quality of the regression model.  The `cross_val_scores`
# provides a measure of how well the meta-model predicts the experimental 
# outcomes, similar to an $R^2$ measure on a linear regression model.

# %%
mm.cross_val_scores()

# %% [markdown]
# We can apply the meta-model directly on a new design of experiments, and 
# use the `contrast_experiments` visualization tool to review how well the
# meta-model is replicating the underlying model's results.
