	"""
	Render a visualization of experimental results.

	This function will display the outputs in a jupyter notebook,
	but does not actually return any values.

	Parameters
	----------
	scope : emat.Scope
		The scope to use in identifying parameters and performance
		measures.
	experiment_results : pandas.DataFrame or str
		The complete results from a set of experiments,
		including parameter inputs and performance measure
		outputs.  Give a string to name a design in the database.
	db : emat.Database, optional
		When either of the `experiments` arguments is given as
		a string, the experiments are loaded from this database
		using the scope name as well as the given string as the
		design name.
	render (str or dict or None, default 'png'): If given, the graph[s]
		will be rendered to a static image using `plotly.io.to_image`.
		For default settings, pass 'png', or give a dictionary
		that specifies keyword arguments to that function. If no
		rendering is done (by setting `render` to None), the raw
		plotly figures are returned -- this may result in a very
		large number of javascript figures and may slow down your
		browser.
	measures : Collection, optional
		A subset of measures to include.  If not given, all
		measures from the defined scope are included.
	mass : int or emat.viz.ScatterMass, default 1000
		The target number of rendered points in each figure. Setting
		to a number less than the number of experiments will make
		each scatter point partially transparent, which will help
		visually convey relative density when there are a very large
		number of points.
